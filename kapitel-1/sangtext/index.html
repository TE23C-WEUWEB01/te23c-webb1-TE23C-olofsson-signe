  <h1>Youtiful</h1>

  <h2>Sångtexter</h2>

  <p>Looking at yourself
    A lot goes in your mind <br>
    "I don't know if I'm ready to show myself"<br>
    You worry day and night <br>
    Look at the stars fall<br>
    They leave the sky, goodbye<br>
    Must be an oracle, like a waterfall<br>
    They shower you with love tonight</p>

  <p>'Cause you are <br>
    You're perfect in my eyes <br>
    You are <br>
    Don't ever doubt yourself <br>
    (You are) I know that feeling too, I've been inside the dark <br>
    I've never been so empty, hopeless <br>
    (You are) but no, it isn't true <br>
    'Cause know that all the stars are by your side</p>

  <p>You know whenever there's a chance <br>
    I'll tell you that you're amazing as you are <br>
    'Cause when you give me a glance <br>
    I'm sure that I see the universe in your eyes <br>
    Don't you ever tell yourself that you're not enough <br>
    I am certain that you're truly fine <br>
    You are a miracle, miracle <br>
    You are youtiful</p>

  <P>Let me tell a little story <br>
    About the star that couldn't shine or blink <br>
    Out of a million, billion <br>
    Felt like an alien, alien <br>
    Then that little star was surely <br>
    Going to become the biggest thing <br>
    Making a fantasy family <br>
    Beautiful galaxy, galaxy</P>

  <P>'Cause you are <br>
    More than beautiful, one of a kind <br>
    You are <br>
    Just know I'm always by your side</P>

  <P>You know whenever there's a chance
    I'll tell you that you're amazing as you are <br>
    'Cause when you give me a glance <br>
    I'm sure that I see the universe in your eyes <br>
    Don't you ever tell yourself that you're not enough <br>
    I am certain that you're truly fine <br>
    You are a miracle, miracle <br>
    You are youtiful</P>

  <P>Another day ahead, don't wanna leave the bed <br>
    You're looking at the mirror, see the tears covered in red <br>
    I know that you've been cold this whole time <br>
    But now I'm here to make it end</P>
  <p>You know whenever there's a chance <br>
    I'll tell you that you're amazing as you are (amazing as you are) <br>
    'Cause when you give me a glance <br>
    I'm sure that I see the universe in your eyes (universe in your eyes) <br>
    Don't you ever tell yourself that you're not enough <br>
    I am certain that you're truly fine (certain that you're truly fine) <br>
    You are a miracle, miracle <br>
    You are youtiful</p>
